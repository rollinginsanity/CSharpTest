CSharpTest
==========

Just a Test and Learn to see how much C# I remember, evidently not much :(

This is just a simple calculator app with three different functions, add, multiply and subtract, with some basic error handling.

Hopefully you can learn something from this...

Just take a look in the MainWindow.xaml.cs file for the code for the calculator, or download the project and run the .sln file.

ENJOY.
